# Python Overview

## Using Python

```shell
$ python3
Python 3.5.2+ (default, Sep 10 2016, 10:24:58)
[GCC 6.2.0 20160901] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello RoboCup!")
Hello RoboCup!
```

## Basic Syntax

```python
# Hello world
print("Hello World!")

# Set a variable
myinteger = 1
mydouble = 1.0
mystr = "one"

print(myinteger)
print(mydouble)
print(mystr)
```

    Hello World!
    1
    1.0
    one

## Functions

```python
def func1(a, b):
    return a + b

print(func1(2, 4))

# Lambda Expressions ('advanced' topic)
def secret_func():
    return "RoboCup!"
def welcome(target):
    return "Welcome to " + target()

print(welcome(secret_func))
print(welcome(lambda: "RoboJackets!"))
# Lambda with arguments
# print(welcome(lambda arg1, arg2: "RoboJackets!"))
```

    6
    Welcome to RoboCup!
    Welcome to RoboJackets!

## Object Oriented Python

```python
class BaseClass():
    globalVar = 1

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
	print("Initializing a Base")
	self.localVar = 2

class ChildClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
	super().__init__() # call superclass constructor
	print("Initializing Child")
	print("Our local var is: " + str(self.localVar))

a = BaseClass()
print("---")
a = ChildClass()
```

    Initializing a Base
    ---
    Initializing a Base
    Initializing Child
    Our local var is: 2

# State Machines

## What is it?

-   A state machine is a series of states
-   You can transition between them
-   A state could have multiple transition
-   A state transition only occurs if a condition is fulfilled

### Examples

-   A car engine is a state machine, each piston going between different internal states to move the car forward
-   A washing machine is a state machine, going between different states to cycle between wash, dry, etc.
-   [Wikipedia Page on State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)

# Plays, Tactics, Skills

-   A Basic Unit in our AI
-   Only one Play can run at a time

## Skill

-   Involves only *one* robot
-   Extremely basic building blocks
-   Examples
    -   Move
    -   Kick
    -   Face a direction
    -   Capture the ball
-   Located in `soccer/gameplay/skills/`

## Tactics

-   Involves multiple robots
-   Contains skills
-   Can contain unique behavior (but usually not)
-   Examples
    -   Pass
    -   Defend
    -   Line Up
-   Located in `soccer/gameplay/tactics/`

## Plays

-   Only one can run
-   Contains tactics
-   Examples
    -   Basic122 (basic offense)
    -   Two side attack (basic offense)
    -   Stopped Play
    -   Line Up
    -   Corner Kick
-   Located in `soccer/gameplay/plays/*/`

### Notes

-   Only plays are actually runnable in our model
    -   If you want to run a tactic, make a dummy play that runs that tactic on startup
-   For now, we'll only look at plays to keep things simple (maybe we'll get more complex later)

# Basic Plays and State Machines

-   Every Play is a State Machine as well!
-   Plays use State Machines to tell them what to do
-   This is a good thing, since we can have very complex behavior in a play
