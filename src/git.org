* Prerequisites                                                        :docs:
- Have ~git~ installed via:
  - ~sudo apt install git~ on ubuntu
  - [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][Install for Windows from here]].
- Know the following commands (run in ~git bash~ or in your terminal)
  - ~pwd~
  - ~cd~
  - ~ls~
  - ~mkdir~
  - ~rm~
  - Learn these and more [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal#File_.26_Directory_Commands][here]]!
- Have a text editor installed and be comfortable using it!
  - Gui or terminal does not matter.
* Git
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Stupid Content Tracker
#+END_QUOTE
- ~git~ is /NOT/ GitHub.
- GitHub is 'server git'
** Why ~git~ over another VCS?
- Branching and Merging
- */FAST/*
- Powerful, and Flexible
- Free (as in freedom, and as in beer)
** Why ~git~ over another client?
- ~git~ is the 1st party front-end
- ~git~ is the way it was designed to be experienced.
- Learning ~git~ is the easiest way to understand what's going on.
- ~git~ gives you ultimate, uninhibited access to your repository.
* Basic Git Commands
- Follow along on your own computer!
** Creating a ~git~ Repo
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Create a folder named 'repo'
  mkdir repo
  # Move inside 'repo'
  cd repo
  # Create a git repository where we are
  # (created inside the repo folder)

  git init
  # > Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/repo/.git/
  git status
  # > On branch master
  # > Initial commit
  # > nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

  # Use cd .. to move up a directory
#+END_SRC
** Adding /Content/
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Create a file called file.txt with some text in it.
  # Example:
  echo "this is a line to be stored into git" > file.txt
  git status
  # > Untracked files:
  # >   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
  # >     file.txt
  git add file.txt
  # > Changes to be committed:
  # >   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
  # >         new file:   file.txt

  # This message should reflect the change. We'll come back to this.
  git commit -m "Added a small amount of content"


#+END_SRC
** Staging Area
[[file:http://i.imgur.com/4nql3LO.jpg]]
** Viewing History
- ~git~ versions are 'hashes'
  - Something like: =cbbd8d9a5e...=
  - You don't need the full hash to refer to a commit
    - Only use ~6 chars from the front.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Show the latest commit
  git show

  # Show all commits (use q to quit)
  git log
#+END_SRC
** Git History
- Every git version is linked to it's previous versions:
- =v1 <- v2 <- v3 <- v4=
- A version can have multiple previous versions
  - Let's demonstrate this in...
* Git Branching
- We'll discuss what we're doing in a bit
- Let's create a new feature, but we know it's going to be buggy
  - Let's create it in an isolated environment, a branch!
** Create a feature branch
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Create a myfeature branch
  git branch myfeature
  # Move to myfeature branch
  git checkout myfeature

  # Let's find out where we are
  git status
  # > On branch myfeature
  # > nothing to commit, working tree clean
#+END_SRC
** Add a new 'feature'
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
echo "My new feature!" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m 'My new feature is very cool, but buggy!'
#+END_SRC
** There's a bug in the released version!
- Let's patch the version everyone is on, the master release!
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Switch back to the master branch
  git checkout master
  git status
  # Look at the contents of file.txt at this point!

  echo "My critical bugfix!" >> file.txt
  git add file.txt
  git commit -m "Critical bugfix number 1!"
#+END_SRC
** What just happened?
- We first created our test file, which is our 'release version'
- Then we created a feature branch, and made some 'buggy changes'
- We then realized we need to fix a bug in the 'release version'
  - We switched back to release, and 'fixed the bug'
** Let's take a closer look
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # A much nicer git log that will visualize our history
  git log --oneline --graph --all

  git show <commit hash>
#+END_SRC
** Merging
- Brings divergent branches together
- Let's release our feature by putting it into the master branch

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # We want to merge INTO master
  git checkout master

  # Merge myfeature into master
  git merge myfeature
  # > Auto-merging file.txt
  # > CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
  # > Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

  # That's not good!
  git status
  # Edit file.txt to remove >>> <<< and ===
  git add file.txt
  git commit # Just save whatever pops up
  git status
#+END_SRC
* Git Remotes
- How do we share our code with others?
- Branching is great for me, but what if I want to let my friends work on a branch?
** Let's Play With Remotes
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # let's start in a common state
  git checkout master

  # let's make a copy for 'our friend to have'
  cd ..
  # Clone from the repo folder to the repo2 folder
  git clone repo/ repo2/
  cd repo2
  git status
  # > On branch master
  # > Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
  # > nothing to commit, working tree clean
  git log --oneline --abbrev --graph --all
  # *   8f12721 Merge branch 'myfeature'
  # |\
  # | * 2716a3b Add a new feature
  # * | 625aaf5 Critical bugfix
  # |/
  # * cbbd8d9 one small change
#+END_SRC
** Let's Make a Change On 'our computer'
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Move into 'our repo'
  cd ../repo
  git status

  # Edit file.txt with our changes
  echo "A change I made on my computer" >> file.txt

  git add file.txt
  git commit -m 'Added files from my computer.'
#+END_SRC
** Let's Give This Change To Our Friend
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Pull new changes from repo's master into repo2's master
  cd ../repo2
  git pull ../repo master
  # > From ../repo
  # >  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
  # > Updating 8f12721..2b05fa9
  # > Fast-forward
  # >  file.txt | 1 +
  # >  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
#+END_SRC
** Shortcuts to make remotes faster
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Add a shortcut to interact with ../repo2
  cd ../repo
  git remote add repo2 ../repo2
  # same as git pull ../repo2 master
  git pull repo2 master
  # > From ../repo2
  # >  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
  # > Already up-to-date.

  # List existing remotes
  git remote -v
  # > repo2       ../repo2 (fetch)
  # > repo2       ../repo2 (push)

  # man git-remote for more options, like
  # git remote set-url repo2 ../repo2
  # git remote rm repo2
  # git remote show repo2
#+END_SRC
