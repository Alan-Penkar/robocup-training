# Reference Sheet
There's a lot of vocabulary to remember. Here's a cheat sheet.

## Field Dimensions
Reference File Here

constants.Field.Length - Vertical length of the field
constants.Field.Width - Horizontal width of the field

(0, 0) is the middle of the field at our goal. Thus, the center of the field would be the point (constants.Field.Length / 2, 0)

## Robot and Ball Properties. 
Reference File Here

main.ball.pos() - get the robots position
