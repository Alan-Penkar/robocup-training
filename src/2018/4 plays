* Let's write a play

** Let's get started
- Copy paste basic122 into a new file
- Do something

** Here are some play ideas
- The best defense...
	- No robots on defense. Every robot tries to capture the ball and pivot kick it into the goal.
- Chicken
	- 1 goalie. Every other robot is a submissive defender. 
- Everybody loves Mark
	- Every robot marks an enemy robot
- or come up with your own!

** FIGHT
