* Folders

* Purpose
- Computer science is a language. 
- While you may be well-versed in this language, robocup-software is essentially a textbook that defines its own terminology
- Thus, you have to know how to look up words that you don't know
- This will be helpful in understanding the codebase and make contributions

# Files to read through. Repeated Line Up, Basic122, Mark?
* Tips
- I will teach you how to read using sublime
- While you can do this using other text editors, it's pretty easy with sublime

* Setting up
- On sublime, open robocup-software using the "open folder" option under file
- This allows us to search through the entirety of robocup software using sublime tools

* Search Tools
- Control + Shift + F will search the entire project for the occurence of a term.
- Control + P will search the entire project for the name of a file.
- In the terminal, you can use git grep "<term>" to search the whole repository for the occurence of a term.

* Let's read over some files together

** Some questions to ask yourself
- Do you know what the variables represent?
	- Doesn't have to be exact
	- Conceptual understanding is more important
- Do you know what each method does?
	- Conceptual Understanding
- Do I understand everything that is language-specific?
	- Ex. Ternary statements in python.
	- Will be more problematic with C++.
