# Syllabus 2018

## Goals

* Expose new members to the different facets of robocup-software
	* RRT
	* Soccer / Plays
	* Firmware
	* C++ and Path Planning
	* and many more!
* Provide them with the knowledge and resources to contribute to robocup-software

This year, training will focus more on plays, and will go slower than in previous years. We will allow new members to focus on different areas if they would like, but focusing on soccer is very visual, and allows for very quantifiable progress, which helps with retention and helping new members not feel as overwhelmed as they learn more about the code base. 

Another important skill I would like to focus on is the ability to read code like a textbook. This is most likely the largest codebase that the new members have seen, and like any high-level literature, it requires a higher vocabulary to understand. Because the vocabulary is located within the codebase, we will need to show them how to look up and understand vocabulary. 

Also provide new members with reference sheet. 

## Meetings

Because we have 6 meetings, we have to be very economical with our lessons. I would prefer to have very basic lessons that new members understand 100% than have harder lessons that they understand 50%. 

### Training Meeting 1: Installation and Getting Started
The goal of this meeting is for installation and getting to know us. If there's a way to speed up this process, I would love to, but it seems as if it always takes the whole time.

The only positive outcome that I can see is how we establish culture in this time period. This is our introduction, and be friendly meeting. 

Another idea is that this can be a meeting where teach them how to look up vocabulary.
