# Syllabus 2018

## Goals

* Expose new members to the different facets of robocup-software
	* RRT
	* Soccer / Plays
	* Firmware
	* C++ and Path Planning
	* and many more!
* Provide them with the knowledge and resources to contribute to robocup-software

This year, training will focus more on plays, and will go slower than in previous years. We will allow new members to focus on different areas if they would like, but focusing on soccer is very visual, and allows for very quantifiable progress, which helps with retention and helping new members not feel as overwhelmed as they learn more about the code base. 

Another important skill I would like to focus on is the ability to read code like a textbook. This is most likely the largest codebase that the new members have seen, and like any high-level literature, it requires a higher vocabulary to understand. Because the vocabulary is located within the codebase, we will need to show them how to look up and understand vocabulary. 

Teaching things:
* If someone understands things, ask them to help people around them.
* Ask people if they have questions, even if it's unprompted. 

## Meetings

Because we have 6 meetings, we have to be very economical with our lessons. I would prefer to have very basic lessons that new members understand 100% than have harder lessons that they understand 50%. 

### Training Meeting 1: Installation and Getting Started
The goal of this meeting is for installation, github, and getting to know us. I would love to speed up this process, but it seems as if it always takes the whole time.

The only positive outcome that I can see is how we establish culture in this time period. This is our introduction, and be friendly meeting. 

Another idea is that this can be a meeting where teach them how to look up vocabulary. 

Slide Changes: stay mostly the same

Extension: Show Robocup Footage? cool linux things? Memes?

### Training Meeting 2: Basic Movement and Field Awareness
The goal of this meeting is for people to understand the robot skills around as well as field parameters. We will start with programming fundamentals. If we have time, we can introduce state machines using print statements.

Learning Goals
* How do we move a robot
* What points correspond to different locations on a field
	* Includes corners of the field, center, and goals
* How does a robot capture a ball
* How do we pass to another robot
* How do we kick at the goal?

Slide Changes: We will not worry about state machines here. Focus just on moving the robot and understanding the boundaries of the field. 

Extension: Add Tactics and Skills here. Triangle pass.?

### Training Meeting 3: State Machines, Tactics, Skills 
Learning Goals
* Solidify everything from last meeting
* How do the individual skills become a tactic
* How do State Machines work? (basic)

Slide Changes: State Machines. Mention Role Requirements but dont go into it. Implement a tactic or multiple tactics?

Extension: Write a play. 

### Training Meeting 4: Write a play
Learning Goals
* Solidify State Machines
* How to write a basic play

### Training Meeting 5: Unknown
Ideas:
* Run plays against each other
* RRT
* Overview of other areas of robocup-software
* "Literature" Lesson: How to read code you dont understand

### Training Meeting 6: Contributions
Pretty much keep same.
