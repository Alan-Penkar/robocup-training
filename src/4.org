  - Role Requirements
  - Creating Plays
** Additional Information                                             :docs:
- See the previous slide deck and docs for more information, they should be a pretty comprehensive overview of our play system.
* Misc Plays Information

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # Returns True if we have any subbehaivors

** Docs                                                               :docs:
- [[https://robojackets.github.io/robocup-software/classgameplay_1_1behavior_1_1_behavior.html][These are docs for this section. Check subclass docs as well!]]
* CoordinatedPass Overview
- Coordinated Pass is a complicated tactic with a lot of different features
- It is used everywhere, and it isn't terribly complicated
** TODO INSERT COORDINATED PASS DIAGRAM HERE
** Go through Coordinated Pass
** Overview                                                           :docs:
- We went through everything in coordinated pass, which is located [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/blob/master/soccer/gameplay/tactics/coordinated_pass.py][here]].
- Using what we learnt in previous sections, this should be fairly self explanitory.
- For a high level overview, check out the [[https://robojackets.github.io/robocup-software/classgameplay_1_1tactics_1_1coordinated__pass_1_1_coordinated_pass.html][coordinated pass]] docs page.
* Assignment
- Create a Triangle Pass Play
- Round up 3 Robots in a Triangle, and pass between them.
- Starter code is in ~soccer/gameplay/plays/skel/binary_clock.py~ (same as last time).
- Move it to ~soccer/gameplay/plays/training/triangle_pass.py~ to begin.
** Tips
1. Use Move Skills to move your robots to the triangle initially
2. Use the CoordinatedPass Tactic to pass between, setting receive points as sides of the triangle
3. At a bare minimum, I would make setup and passing states. You may want to have a state for every side of the triangle (or not).
